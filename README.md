#  Pong {Python Game}
The game is called Pong, and it is a classic arcade game that simulates table tennis. The game consists of two paddles and a ball that bounce on the screen. The goal of the game is to hit the ball with the paddle and prevent it from going past the edge of the screen. The player who misses the ball loses a point, and the game ends when one player reaches a certain score.

To play the game, you need to use the keyboard to control the paddles. You can use the Up and Down arrow keys to move the right paddle, and the W and S keys to move the left paddle. You can also adjust the game speed by changing the sleep time in the game loop.

The game is written in Python, using the turtle module to create the graphics and the events. The game code is divided into several files, each containing a class that defines the behavior and attributes of the game objects. The main.py file is the main script that runs the game loop and imports the other files. The paddle.py file contains the Paddle class that creates and moves the paddles. The ball.py file contains the Ball class that creates and moves the ball, and handles the collisions with the walls and the paddles. The scoreboard.py file contains the Scoreboard class that displays and updates the score. The line.py file contains the Line class that creates the line that divides the screen.

## Tech Stack
The game was created using the following technologies:

â€¢  Python: This is a popular and versatile programming language that has many modules and libraries for various functionalities and features. Python was used to write the main script and the custom modules for the game objects.

â€¢  Turtle: This is a built-in module in Python that allows drawing graphics and animations using turtle objects. Turtle was used to create and manage the screen, the line, the paddles, the ball, and the scoreboard.

â€¢  Time: This is a built-in module in Python that provides functions for working with time and dates. Time was used to control the game speed by pausing the execution for a certain amount of time.

â€¢  Keyboard events: These are functions from the turtle module that allow binding keyboard keys to turtle methods. Keyboard events were used to handle the user input and the paddle movements.




## Documentation
Here are the links to the official web pages for each technology:

â€¢  Python: This is the official documentation for Python 3.12.0, which covers the language reference, the library reference, the tutorials, and more.https://www.python.org/doc/

â€¢  Turtle: This is the official documentation for the turtle module, which provides turtle graphics primitives, in both object-oriented and procedure-oriented ways.https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html

â€¢  Time: This is the official documentation for the time module, which provides various time-related functions, such as getting the current time, sleeping for a certain amount of time, and formatting time values.https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html

â€¢  Keyboard events: These are the functions from the turtle module that allow binding keyboard keys to turtle methods, such as onkey () and listen ().
## Lessons Learned
Creating Pong in Python is a fun and challenging way to learn some of the basic concepts and skills of programming and game development. Some of the lessons that can be learned by creating Pong are:

â€¢  How to use the turtle module, which is a built-in library in Python that allows you to create graphics and animations using turtle objects. You can learn how to create and customize turtle objects, how to move them around the screen, how to draw shapes and lines, and how to handle keyboard events.https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-code-pong-in-python/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-pong-game-using-python-turtle/https://medium.com/@rasmussep/step-by-step-guide-creating-a-classic-pong-game-in-python-using-the-turtle-module-2a820a442ea7

â€¢  How to use classes and inheritance, which are important features of object-oriented programming. You can learn how to define classes that represent the game objects, such as the paddles, the ball, and the scoreboard. You can also learn how to use inheritance to create subclasses that inherit the attributes and methods of a parent class, such as the Turtle class.https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-code-pong-in-python/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-pong-game-using-python-turtle/https://medium.com/@rasmussep/step-by-step-guide-creating-a-classic-pong-game-in-python-using-the-turtle-module-2a820a442ea7

â€¢  How to use loops and conditionals, which are essential tools for controlling the flow of the program. You can learn how to use loops to repeat certain actions, such as moving the ball and the paddles, and checking for collisions. You can also learn how to use conditionals to execute different actions based on certain conditions, such as bouncing the ball, updating the score, and ending the game.https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-code-pong-in-python/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-pong-game-using-python-turtle/https://medium.com/@rasmussep/step-by-step-guide-creating-a-classic-pong-game-in-python-using-the-turtle-module-2a820a442ea7

â€¢  How to use functions and methods, which are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. You can learn how to define functions and methods that encapsulate the logic and behavior of the game, such as moving the paddles, bouncing the ball, and resetting the position. You can also learn how to call functions and methods using arguments and parameters, and how to return values from them.https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-code-pong-in-python/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-pong-game-using-python-turtle/https://medium.com/@rasmussep/step-by-step-guide-creating-a-classic-pong-game-in-python-using-the-turtle-module-2a820a442ea7

â€¢  How to use variables and constants, which are names that store data and values. You can learn how to use variables to store the state and properties of the game objects, such as the coordinates, the velocities, and the scores. You can also learn how to use constants to store fixed values that do not change, such as the screen size, the paddle size, and the move distance.https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-code-pong-in-python/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-pong-game-using-python-turtle/https://medium.com/@rasmussep/step-by-step-guide-creating-a-classic-pong-game-in-python-using-the-turtle-module-2a820a442ea7
